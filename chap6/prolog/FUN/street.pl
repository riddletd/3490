/*
 * The street problem.

   There is a street with three neighbouring houses that all have a
   different colour, namely red, blue, and green. People of different
   nationalities live in the different houses and they all have a
   different pet. Here are some more facts about them:

   1. The Englishman lives in the red house.
   2. The jaguar is the pet of the Spanish family.
   3. The Japanese lives to the right of the snail keeper.
   4. The snail keeper lives to the left of the blue house.
   5. Who keeps the zebra?

   Donâ€™t work it out for yourself: define a predicate zebra/1 that tells
   you the nationality of the owner of the zebra!
   ?- zebra(Who).    tells you who

  (Hint: Think of a representation for the houses and the street.
         Code the four constraints in Prolog.
	 You may find member/2 and sublist/2 useful.)
