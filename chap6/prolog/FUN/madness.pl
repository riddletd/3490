    Four friends plan to meet to watch NCAA March Madness.
    Each friend roots for a different team and will bring a different
    snack to the watch party. 

    Your task is to uncover the matchings.

    1. The Duke fan will bring pretzels.
    2. Neither the UNC fan, nor Betty, nor Mark (who roots for UVA) will 
       bring chips.
    3. George, who does not root for NCState, will bring coke.
    4. Drew will not bring the redbull.

    Note, solution is unique.

    Nice output please...
